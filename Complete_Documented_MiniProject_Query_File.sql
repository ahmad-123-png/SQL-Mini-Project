-- But this is a manual procedure and may not work in larger more practical datasets. Hence, the code below is with subqueries and dervied tables.

-- More info on derived tables:

/*

A derived table is essentially a subquery used in the FROM clause of a query, and it must have an alias. 

Itâ€™s like treating the result of a subquery as if it were a table, and it only exists for the duration of that query. 
Derived tables are often used when you need to reference the result of a subquery as a "temporary table."

Example of a Derived Table:


-- Running a query to retrieve data based on specific conditions
SELECT t.investor, COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM (

-- Running a query to retrieve data based on specific conditions
    SELECT investors_1 AS investor FROM unicorns
    UNION ALL

-- Running a query to retrieve data based on specific conditions
    SELECT investors_2 AS investor FROM unicorns
    UNION ALL

-- Running a query to retrieve data based on specific conditions
    SELECT investors_3 AS investor FROM unicorns
) AS t
  -- Grouping results to aggregate data by unique values in specified columns
GROUP BY t.investor
  -- Sorting the query result based on specified columns
ORDER BY total_count DESC;
Alias (t): The derived table (the subquery inside the FROM clause) is given an alias (t) so that it can be referenced later in the query, for example, in GROUP BY or SELECT.)
